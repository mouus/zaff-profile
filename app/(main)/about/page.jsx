          My career in diving began in 2011, when Fuvahmulah had no dive centers or equipment readily
          available. Despite the lack of resources, my passion for the ocean kept driving me forward.
          I remember borrowing scuba gear from a local fishing boat and, alongside a few friends,
          venturing out into the waters near the harbor. That&lsquo;s when I saw my first tiger sharkâ€”a
          moment that changed everything. I shared the news with others, but many didn&lsquo;t believe that
          tiger sharks could be found here. <br /><br />
          Undeterred, I gathered a few divers who shared my enthusiasm, and together we explored what
          would soon become Fuvahmulah&lsquo;s famous tiger shark diving site. Slowly but surely, others
          began to recognize the potential. Local entrepreneurs, like Mr. Saud, opened guest houses
          and began offering dives to this special spot. I was proud to guide the first of many
          divers, helping put Fuvahmulah on the map as a premier diving destination. <br /><br />
          What started as a dream, against all odds, has grown into a thriving industry. Today, we
          have multiple dive centers and guest houses, and Fuvamulah is recognized as the world&lsquo;s
          top tiger shark diving destination. I&lsquo;m proud of the role I&lsquo;ve played in this journey, and
          I remain committed to pushing this industry further, continuing to develop and promote the
          incredible underwater world that we&lsquo;re fortunate to call home.
